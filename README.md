Plamenak-bot is a Discord bot made in C# but it is more of "mess" that needs to be refactored as at first it used to be a private project for funzies and not for intent to be used as an actual tool. 
Because of this there can be some non-professional variable names such as "xd". Anytime a variable is called like this (vague, nothing telling name) it is used just as an temporary / helper variable. 

As already mentioned bot used to be a small project just for a private server with my friends but eventually it grew into a very useful tool that we nowadays use for event organizing.
Most important stuff is located in Commands.cs


The project is currently in refactoring stage.
